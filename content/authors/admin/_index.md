My research focuses on distributionally robustness optimization in economics and financial models. During my Ph.D. study at UConn, I have taught undergraduate courses in econometrics and financial economics. My teaching interests are quantitative methods for economics and business, machine learning, and open-source programming (i.e., R/Python).
